        <div class="line"></div>
      <p> I love reading lots of fiction/fantasy stories!! since I have a kindle loads of books which may not be found on ammazon or a bookstore is in it. currently, I am on the last book of Fairy Tale Reform School (FTRS), which is the best book ever!! and it isnt very well known so it would be hard to find the physical copy of that book but with the kindle reading is easier and so much more fun!! </p>
